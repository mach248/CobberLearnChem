Hereâ€™s what happened:
The pre-trained VGG16 model was successfully loaded.
Your input image was preprocessed correctly.
The model predicted the object in the image as an African elephant with 92% confidence, followed by tusker at 7%.
The rest of the predictions had very low confidence, which is expected if the top match is strong.
This shows that your image processing pipeline is solid and your TensorFlow + VGG16 setup is running smoothly.
Also displayed the input image with prediction label.
