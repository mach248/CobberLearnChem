Pitfalls of Using the Mean to Fill Missing Values

    It distorts the distribution

        Mean imputation reduces the natural variability in your data.

        It can make the distribution look artificially “tight” and underestimate variance.

    It ignores correlations with other variables

        It treats all passengers the same, regardless of their gender, class, or other features that might relate to age.

        For example, younger passengers might be more common in 3rd class — but mean imputation can't reflect that.

    It can bias model training

        If you're using the dataset for machine learning, repeated mean values can skew model training or reduce accuracy, especially with models sensitive to outliers or distributions (e.g., linear regression).

    It assumes missingness is random

        If data are not missing at random (e.g., older people’s ages are more likely to be missing), then mean imputation introduces systematic bias.

 Better Alternatives (Context-Dependent)

    Median imputation: More robust to outliers.

    Group-wise imputation: Use the average age within each group (e.g., by gender or class).

    Model-based imputation: Predict missing values using other features.

    Multiple imputation: Statistically models uncertainty by generating several versions of the dataset.
