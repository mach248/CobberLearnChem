This code does the following:

    Prepares the data for KNN imputation by:
        Converting categorical variables to numeric using one-hot encoding
        Standardizing the features (important for KNN to work properly)
        Selecting relevant features for the imputation model

    Evaluates the KNN imputation model by:
        Splitting the known age data into training and test sets
        Applying KNN imputation to the test set
        Calculating the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between actual and predicted ages
        Plotting actual vs. predicted ages to visualize the model's performance

    Applies KNN imputation to the entire dataset and:
        Reports the average age before and after imputation
        Reports the average of only the imputed values
        Visualizes the distribution of ages before and after imputation
        Compares KNN imputation with mean imputation for the missing values

The plots will help you visualize:

    How well the KNN model predicts known ages
    How the distribution of ages changes after imputation
    How KNN imputation differs from simple mean imputation for the missing values
