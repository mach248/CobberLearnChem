These results are much more realistic and provide some interesting insights! Let me analyze them for you:

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 11.05 years

This indicates that, on average, the KNN imputation model's predictions are off by about 11 years from the actual ages. This is a significant error, but not unexpected for age prediction based on limited features. Age can be difficult to predict accurately from demographic and travel information alone.

Some context:
- For age prediction, an MAE of 11.05 years is relatively high but not unreasonable given the limited features in the Titanic dataset
- In real-world applications, MAEs for age prediction typically range from 5-15 years depending on the available features
- This suggests that while KNN imputation is better than simple mean imputation, it still has limitations for this particular task

### Average Ages

- Original average (excluding missing values): 29.70 years
- After KNN imputation (all values): 29.79 years
- Imputed values only: 30.15 years

These values tell us:

1. The KNN imputation produced values that are slightly higher on average (30.15) than the original known ages (29.70)
2. The difference between the original mean and the post-imputation mean is small (0.09 years), suggesting the imputation didn't drastically shift the overall age distribution
3. The imputed values are only slightly higher than the mean (30.15 vs 29.70), indicating that KNN is doing more than just predicting values close to the mean

### Interpretation

These results suggest that:

1. **KNN imputation is working as expected**: It's producing reasonable but imperfect predictions, which is normal for imputation methods.

2. **The imputation quality is moderate**: An MAE of 11.05 years indicates that while the model can capture some patterns, there's significant uncertainty in the predictions.

3. **The imputed values maintain the dataset's characteristics**: The small change in the overall mean (29.70 â†’ 29.79) suggests the imputation preserves the general age distribution.

4. **KNN is adding value beyond mean imputation**: The fact that the imputed values have a different mean (30.15) than the original data (29.70) shows that KNN is using the relationships between variables to make more nuanced predictions than simply using the mean.

### Recommendations

1. **Consider this imputation acceptable but imperfect**: The KNN imputation is reasonable for exploratory analysis, but you should acknowledge its limitations in any conclusions.

2. **Try different values of k (neighbors)**: The current code uses k=5. You might experiment with different values (3, 7, 10) to see if the MAE improves.

3. **Feature engineering might help**: Creating new features that have stronger relationships with age could improve the imputation quality.

4. **Consider multiple imputation**: For critical analyses, you might want to use multiple imputation techniques to account for the uncertainty in the imputed values.

5. **Sensitivity analysis**: For any important conclusions that depend on age, check if they hold when using different imputation methods.

Overall, these results are reasonable and what I would expect from KNN imputation on the Titanic dataset. The MAE of 11.05 years indicates moderate prediction quality, and the small change in the overall mean suggests the imputation is preserving the dataset's characteristics.

ðŸ”„ **Alternative Approaches**

If you want to improve the imputation quality, you could try these alternatives:

```python
# Try different numbers of neighbors
for k in [3, 5, 7, 10, 15]:
    knn_imputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=k)
    knn_imputer.fit(X_train)
    X_test_imputed = knn_imputer.transform(X_test_with_nan)
    X_test_imputed_df = pd.DataFrame(X_test_imputed, columns=X_test_with_nan.columns, index=X_test_with_nan.index)
    y_pred = X_test_imputed_df['age']
    mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true[mask], y_pred[mask])
    print(f"MAE with k={k} neighbors: {mae:.2f} years")

# Try a regression-based imputation approach
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Prepare data for regression imputation
X_train_reg = X_train.drop('age', axis=1)
y_train_reg = X_train['age']
X_test_reg = X_test_with_nan.drop('age', axis=1)

# Train a Random Forest regressor
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train_reg, y_train_reg)

# Predict ages for test set
y_pred_rf = rf.predict(X_test_reg)

# Calculate MAE for the artificially introduced NaNs
mae_rf = mean_absolute_error(y_true[mask], y_pred_rf[mask])
print(f"\nMAE with Random Forest imputation: {mae_rf:.2f} years")
```

These approaches might yield better results than the basic KNN imputation, especially the Random Forest regressor which can capture more complex relationships in the data.
